### `bind <vault_target_keyword> [with|without modifier...]`

Thi

**_Properties_**

- `<vault_target_keyword>`: Target source (`environment`, `system`, or `remote`).

**_Modifiers_**

- `with filter {glob}`: Include only names matching glob.
- `with regex {regex}`: Include only names matching regex.

**_Examples_**

---

### `bind system`

---

### `remote`

---

### `remote pull`

---

### `lock`

---

### `unlock`

---

### Ephemeral sensitivity (no vault entry created)

### Store secret in Vault for reuse

```spell
vault lock 'PASSWORD_DEV' with secret @ephemeral_pw.
```

### Bind ENV variables starting with DB\_ into Vault

```spell
vault bind environment with filter 'DB_*'.
```

### Retrieve secrets from Vault

```spell
vault unlock 'PASSWORD_DEV' into @user_password.
vault unlock 'DB_PASS' into @db_secret.
```

### Egress requires with risk

```spell
sensitive say @user_password with risk.
sensitive say @db_secret with risk.
```

## Notes

- Every time you unlock a secret, the value is tainted as sensitive and requires `with sensitive` on use and `with risk` on egress.
- All bind instructions support filtering with `filter` or `regex`.
- Remote vaults require a connection container and secrets are pulled individually.
