# Cabinet

## Description
Cabinet provides cross-platform file and directory manipulation (list, read, write, move, copy, delete) with structured filters and safety clauses.

## Summary Table
| Instruction | Minimal Syntax | Effect | Key Modifiers |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| list        | cabinet list in 'path'. | Enumerate entries | with hidden, with pattern, limit |
| read        | cabinet read file 'path' into @content. | Load file contents | as binary (future), into @ or :: |
| write       | cabinet write file 'path' with content 'text'. | Overwrite/create file | with append (future) |
| delete      | cabinet delete file 'path'. | Remove file | safe elevated |
| move        | cabinet move file 'a' to 'b'. | Rename/move file | - |
| copy        | cabinet copy file 'a' to 'b'. | Duplicate file | - |
| create      | cabinet create folder 'path'. | Make directory | elevated (maybe) |

## Anatomy
Explain command structure: cabinet <verb> <object> [qualifiers] [modifiers] [signatures].

## Syntax
cabinet list in 'path' with pattern '*.log' limit '10'.

## Examples
### 1. Basic Read
cabinet read file '/tmp/app.log' into @log_content.
say @log_content.

### 2. Safe Deletion
safe cabinet delete file '/tmp/old.log'.

### 3. Filtered Listing
cabinet list in '/var/log' with pattern 'sys*' limit '5' into ::logs.
say ::logs:length.

## Edge Cases
- Deleting non-existent file: fails unless prefixed with safe.
- Cross-platform path normalization is automatic (rules …).
- Large directory listing: consider limit + pattern.

## Best Practices
- Always qualify destructive ops with safe unless halting is needed.
- Use pattern + limit to avoid scanning huge trees.
- Pair with result patterns for robust flows.

## Common Errors
E-CAB-NOTFOUND, E-CAB-PERM, E-CAB-TYPE
