# Flow

In feather, the usage of "flow" instructions enable to control the logic based on conditions. Compared to many languages, it's not allowed to embbed condition inside the conditional statement.

## Summary Table

### Conditional

| Instruction                           | Syntax Example | Effect | Notes |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------ | ----- |
| if/else if {condition} ... end        | ``             |        |       |
| any {condition1} {condition2} ... end | ``             |        |       |
| all {condition1} {condition2} ... end | ``             |        |       |

### Loops

| Instruction                                        | Syntax Example | Effect | Notes |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------ | ----- |
| while {condition} ... end                          | ``             |        |       |
| do ... while {condition} end                       | ``             |        |       |
| repeat {value} ... end                             | ``             |        |       |
| increase {iterator} by {value} to {target} ... end | ``             |        |       |
| decrease {iterator} by {value} to {target} ... end | ``             |        |       |
| foreach from ::container into {iterator} ... end   | ``             |        |       |

## Conditionals and Loops

Feather supports straightforward flow control with English-like keywords.

### all

### `if` / `else if` / `else`

Use `if` for conditional logic. `else if` and `else` can be used for additional branches. Always close the block with `end`.

```sky

solve @value > 10 into @greater_than_10.
solve @value > 5 into @greater_than_5.

if @greater_than_10
  say 'Value is greater than 10'.
else if @greater_than_5
  say 'Value is greater than 5'.
else
  say 'Value is 5 or less'.
end
```

4. `timeout`

   â€¢ Flow tags (control timing/scope): once, retry 'N', timeout '5s', parallel/sequential

### `repeat`

Repeat a block a fixed number of times. Close with `end`.

```sky
repeat @count
  say 'looping'
end
```

### `while`

Repeat a block while a condition is true.

```sky
while @count > '0'
  say 'count is @{count}'
  decrease @count to '1'
end
```

### `increase` and `decrease`

Increment or decrease a value up to or down to a target, executing the block each step.

```sky
increase @i by '2' to '10'
  say 'increase: @{i}'
end

decrease @i by '3' to '0'
  say 'decrease: @{i}'
end
```
