• Scalar slot: @name (always text). (single value)
• Object slot: ::name (typed, with projections).
• scalar Projection: ::name:field[:subfield…] (read‑only views).

## Notes on `into`

### For scalars (`@`)

- `@name` stores a single text value (scalar).
- Overwrites the value if already set.
- Always string-based at base level.
- No projection: you always reference the whole scalar.

### For containers (`::`)

- `::container` can store structured or typed data.
- `::container:field` mutates only that field in the container.
- Root assignment overwrites the whole container.
- Type enforcement is applied (e.g., `::boolean` only accepts true/false).

### Mental model

- Scalars (`@`) are “single sticky notes” for text.
- Containers (`::`) are “labeled boxes” that can have types and compartments.
- `into` is the action of putting a value into the right sticky note or box at the end of a sentence.
